I) What is libmem ?
-------------------

libmem is a simple library to easily build (and then bench ;-) different swapping algorithm.




II) Installing and using libmem
-------------------------------

To install libmem, just type

>> make libmem

Then the lib directory will contain libmem.a

If you want some examples, have a look at the sources in the src directory.
You can build them by typing

>> make algorithm

If you only type

>> make

libmem, algorithm plus a simple main program will be build.
